I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. My interests are algorithms, scientific computing, machine learning, and theory. 

I am currently working with Professor [Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/) on problems in sparsity, invariant feature selection, and multitask learning. 

I received my B.S. and M.S. from Cornell University as well, with minors in Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering. My M.S. was advised by [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/).

In my free time I enjoy playing [underwater hockey](https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/underwaterhockey), drawing, and reading. 

My CV is available [here](http://janezdu.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
