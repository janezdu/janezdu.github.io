I am a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. My research interests span Federated Learning, optimization, and differential privacy, with a current focus on personalized federated learning for multitask and multi-domain settings. I'm interested in computationally and communication-efficient methods, sparsity, and provable generalizability.

I am currently working with Professor [Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/) on problems in sparsity, invariant feature selection, and multitask learning. My current project focuses on  finding efficient, trustworthy methods for the personalized federated learning setting. 

I received my B.S. and M.S. from Cornell University as well, with minors in Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering. My M.S. was advised by [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/).
